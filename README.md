## What the script does
This script automates the actions which a normal person would take to tally the followers
and following from the instagram account and check who are the ones who have not followed 
you back and who are the ones who are waiting for you to follow them back.
This also helps to find those people who just follow you for a followback and after getting 
a follow back they unfollow you to just make the number of followers look greater than 
followings.
